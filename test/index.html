				<h1>Question what you see.</h1>
				<p id="p-home">We’re faced with a lot of numbers in the news and popular media. Too often, they come without context – we’re expected to just swallow up the figures and accept any journalistic handwaving. With Dataview, you can see how any statistics were generated, as well as test alternate values for any functions. Maintain healthy skepticism, but rebuild trust between authors and audiences.</p>
