			<p class='home-p'>We’re faced with a lot of numbers in the news and popular media. Too often, they come without context – we’re expected to just swallow up the figures and accept any journalistic hand-waving. With Dataview, you can see how any statistics were generated, as well as test alternate values for any functions. Maintain healthy skepticism, but rebuild trust between authors and audiences.</p>
