		<p class='quote'>"The conception is the imperative. This is why, however much abundance we produce, we cannot solve the problem of poverty and hunger. Since the goal of our mode of production is not to produce for human beings in general, it’s to provide for the material conditions of existence for the production and reproduction of our present conception of being human: to secure the well-being, therefore, of those of us, the global middle class, who have managed to attain its ethno-class criterion."<br>&#8212;Katherine McKittrick, <em><a href='https://www.upress.umn.edu/book-division/books/demonic-grounds'>Demonic Grounds: Black Women and the Cartographies of Struggle</a></em></p>

		<p class='quote'>"In order to speak of the power relations involved in mapping space, it is important to reframe place-based discourse, which has tended toward ethnographic readings of local Native places, and instead look at these discourses as engaging with the forces that construct our understanding of space—whther it is at the scale of the Nation, a sacred site, or the body. Maps produce wider realities and gesture outward."</p>

		<p class='quote'>"Maps were instrumental in the navigation of the slave tradenin the Black Atlantic that provided labor instrumental to conquest, maps erased Native land claims and sacred sites, and maps situate the borderlands that mark the immigrant as a foreign body to be policed and disciplined."<br>&#8212;Mishuana Goeman, <em><a href='https://www.upress.umn.edu/book-division/books/mark-my-words'>Mark My Words: Native Women Mapping Our Nations</a></em></p>

		<p class='quote'>“All hyphens are not equal in the pot that does not melt. The second part of the compound—Irish-American, Jewish-American, Anglo-American—always emphasizes whiteness. The first part only measures compatibility with the second at a given historical moment. Thus, as he became more American, Columbus had to become whiter, in spite of the anti-Italian racism prevailing at the time of the Chicago fair. As Columbus became whiter he also contributed to the whitening of the people who claimed him as part of their past, further opening to multiple interpretations the narrative officialized at Chicago."</p>
		<p class='quote'>"The world of the West basks in what Francois Furet calls the second illusion of truth: what happened is what must have happened. How many of us can think of any non-European population without the background of a global domination that now looks preordained? And how can Haiti, or slavery, or racism be more than distracting footnotes within that narrative order?" <br>&#8212;Michel-Rolph Trouillot, <em><a href='https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/1996-07-01/silencing-past-power-and-production-history'>Silencing the Past: Power and the Production of History</a></em>, p.107</p>

		<p class='quote'>"Black Americans are the only population group of the post-1492 Americas who had been legitimately owned, i.e. enslaved, over several centuries. Their owned and enslaved status had been systemically perceived within the ‘inner eyes’ and the classificatory logic of the earlier <em>episteme</em>, its hegemonic political categories and behaviour-orienting political ethic, to be legitimate and just."<br>&#8212;Sylvia Wynter, <em><a href="https://www.printedmatter.org/catalog/42190/">"No Humans Involved:" An Open Letter to My Colleagues</a></em>, p.62</p>
