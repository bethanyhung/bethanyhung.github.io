		<p class='quote'>“All hyphens are not equal in the pot that does not melt. The second part of the compound—Irish-American, Jewish-American, Anglo-American—always emphasizes whiteness. The first part only measures compatibility with the second at a given historical moment. Thus, as he became more American, Columbus had to become whiter, in spite of the anti-Italian racism prevailing at the time of the Chicago fair. As Columbus became whiter he also contributed to the whitening of the people who claimed him as part of their past, further opening to multiple interpretations the narrative officialized at Chicago."</p>
		<p class='quote'>"The world of the West basks in what Francois Furet calls the second illusion of truth: what happened is what must have happened. How many of us can think of any non-European population without the background of a global domination that now looks preordained? And how can Haiti, or slavery, or racism be more than distracting footnotes within that narrative order?" <br>&#8212;Michel-Rolph Trouillot, <em><a href='https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/1996-07-01/silencing-past-power-and-production-history'>Silencing the Past: Power and the Production of History</a></em>, p.107</p>

		<p class='quote'>"Black Americans are the only population group of the post-1492 Americas who had been legitimately owned, i.e. enslaved, over several centuries.
